The key idea here, as we saw in the recitation (Master Key), is to verify a 'good' command with its right signature
and run our 'bad' command afterwards. 
This is done by passing the run script with 2 enteries of 'command' one of them is the 'echo cool' command which we want to be verified,
and the other is the 'echo hacked' command which we want to execute.
This is possible because Alice and Bob are reading the input in 2 different ways:
    (*) Alice is reading the input with json, which consider it as dictionary, and thats why only the latest command will be 'visible' to the verification.
    (*) Bob is reading the input as a string, and he takes the first command appearence he finds!
