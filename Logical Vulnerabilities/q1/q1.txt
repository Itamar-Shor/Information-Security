According to "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/eval" 
The eval() method parses the expression passed to this method and runs python expression (code) within the program.

In the run.py script, bob is calling eval (without checking first) on the data he found in the file.
As mentioned above, eval is running whatever code it get - so I just gave it 'print(hacked)'.
