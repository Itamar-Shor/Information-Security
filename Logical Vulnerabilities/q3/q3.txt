The run.py script is expacting a string built in the following format - name:pass:cmd.
Bob is parsing this string by getting the first index of the ':' character and consider all the string up to that char as the user name,
and by getting the second index of ':' and consider all the string between the two ':' as the password.
In addition to that, the comparison of the user name and password is made according to the user name and password lenghts that we provided!!!
So, all we need to do is to bob an empty user name and an empty password (::cmd) and the comparison always succeed (empty comparison).
