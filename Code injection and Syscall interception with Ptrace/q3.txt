In order to find the GOT addresses I used - "objdump -D ./binaries/antivirus -M intel --section=.plt" as shown in the rec.
The alternative function I used is opendir.
Explanation:
    The check_if_virus(path) is called only on files and not directory! That is because the program is checking before that if is_directory,
    and if path in sirectory the program does something else.
    When reading the man page of opendir, I understood that if opendir failes its returning NULL which is a fancy word for 0.
    From all this information - opendir on all files (including our maleware) will fail and return 0.

As we saw in the last rec, the first jump instruction in the plt is to the addr srored in the GOT entry.
In order to override check_if_virus GOT entry with opendir GOT entry we need to know addr written in opendir GOT entry.
To do so I used PTRACE_PEEKTEXT.
Then , like in the previous question, I wrote the data in check_if_virus GOT entry.
