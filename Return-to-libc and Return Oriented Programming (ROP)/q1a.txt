Inside check_password function our password (after encoding) is being decoded ans stored in 'buff'.
'buff' is of size 65 bytes (minus the already taken 11 bytes) and 'hash' which is located after 'buff' on the stack is of the same size.
That why I send a password of length 156 to ensure it would override the return address.
