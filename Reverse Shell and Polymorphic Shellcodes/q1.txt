In the function 'handle_connection' (in server.c) the program is writing the message received in local variable 'buff'.
The writing is made by the function 'recv' ,which stops when it reached the message length. Luckily for us we also provide the message length.
'buff' is of size 1024 bytes so just to make sure the message would override the return addr, I sent a message of length 1125.

For later purposes (e.g. finding the begining of 'buff' for q2) I sent a message with assending characters.
