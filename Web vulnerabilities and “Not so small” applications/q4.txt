This attack is a SQL injection.
I notice that there is no check of the new_name in the /renmae operation (only of the username).
If the username exists then the server will envoke the rename_user method which will execute the following SQL command:
    "UPDATE users SET full_name = '%s' WHERE user_id = '%s'" %(new_name, user_id,)

So if we try to change bob's name with the very long name: "Bob Marmite' , password = sha1('1234') WHERE username = 'bob' --"
we will get the following:
    "UPDATE users SET full_name = 'Bob Marmite' , password = sha1('1234') WHERE username = 'bob' (after the -- all is consider a comment).
And this will change bob's password to 1234 as wanted.
