forge_signature implementation:
    The function suppose to return a ServerResponse item which will hold: ATM().verify_server_approval(ServerResponse) == True.
    In order to do so, the status field of the ServerResponse must be ATM.CODE_APPROVAL = 1.
    From this we can conclude that the RSA signature is : sig = (ATM.CODE_APPROVAL)^(secret key)  mod n.
    Because ATM.CODE_APPROVAL = 1 and n != 1 the signature will be 1!! as 1 mod n is always 1 for n != 1.
    Finally, the function returns ServerResponse with: status = ATM.CODE_APPROVAL = 1 and signature = 1.
