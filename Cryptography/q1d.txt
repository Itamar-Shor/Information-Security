def brute_force implementation:
    Iterate over all possible keys of key_length bytes.
    For each key:
        try to decrypt the cipher_text using the curr key.
        calculate the resemblance of the decypted text to an english sentence by usuing plaintext_score.
    return the string with the highest score.

    Some remarks:
        I initiate the max_score to be -1 because , from my plaintext_score implementation, the score is always positive!
        In order to iterate over all keys of key_length bytes, I used an int variable which increamented by 1 at each iteration and then I used to_bytes function
        to convert it to bytes.
