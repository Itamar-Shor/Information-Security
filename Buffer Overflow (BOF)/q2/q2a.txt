In this sudo program there is no size check on the 'password' (=our input to sudo).
Because the function concatenate 'password' to 'buff' using strcat, we can cause 'buff' to overflow.
Now, in order to cause segmantation fault, we want our password to override the return address of the check password method.
The size of 'buff' is 65 bytes and it is the first local variable in check password, that means that our password must be larger then 65
and even more to run over ebp and etc. I chose a password of length 130 bytes just to be certain I override the return addr.
