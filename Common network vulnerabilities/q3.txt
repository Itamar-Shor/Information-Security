I used the following link to verify what are the arguments of the ARP layer:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50703738/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-scapy-arp-attributes.

is_packet_to_original_gateway implemantation:
    I checked if the packet's dastination mac address is the gateway's mac address,
    and that the packet's source ip & mac addresses are not our ip & mac addresses.
    As we saw in class when routing packets to the internet the dastination mac address will be the gateway's mac address, 
    while the dastination ip address will be the actual dastination address.

is_stolen_packet implemantation:
    In order to check if packet is 'stolen' I checked if it's dastination mac address is our mac address, and that it's dastination ip address is different from ours.
    The stolen packets will come to us as a result of our arp table posining. The arp table is a mapping of ip addresses to mac addresses.
    Thats why the stolen packets will have our mac address but not our ip address.

create_poison implemantation:
    I used the following link to verify what are the arguments of the ARP layer:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50703738/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-scapy-arp-attributes.
    Then I used self.addresses to tell the gateway that the victim's ip address should be mapped to our mac address.

Extra notes:
    I used: 'ip route | grep default' to find the gateway ip address.
