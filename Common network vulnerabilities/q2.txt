First of all, I checked if the destination is in fact the course website (like in q1.py).

Now, in order to redirect the user to another location we need to send a ip+tcp packet with the new location.
The packet is composed of 3 layers:
    1.IP.
    2.TCP.
    3.Raw message (bytes).
The Raw messgae is already provided for us in 'RESPONSE'.
In our packet we will replace all dastination addresses (mac and ip) with the source addresses and vice-versa.
The tricky part was the seq and ack numbers ,in the TCP layer, of our packet.
As we saw in class, all tcp communications are numbered in order to guarantee order, thats why we need to adjust those numbers in our packet so the user won't drop it.
According to 'https://packetlife.net/blog/2010/jun/7/understanding-tcp-sequence-acknowledgment-numbers/' the ack number should be the user seq_number plus the length of the user's payload.
The seq number of the response should be the same as the seq number of the request.

In the TCP layer I used the flag 'FA' for FIN and ACK inorder to end the communication (=FIN) and send the redirect message with ack of the user's message (=ACK).
