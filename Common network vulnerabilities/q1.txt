packet_filter implemantation:
    I wanted to check if the packet's destination port is port 80 (=http).
    In order to do so I needed access to the TCP layer of the packet. 
    So, eventually I returned True to all packets with TCP layer that their destination port is port 80.

parse_packet implemantation:
    I stared with checking if the packet has a Raw layer, this is the juicy part (with the username & password).
    If it doesn't I returned None. 
    otherwise, I checked if the string 'HOST: `WEBSITE' is in the packet (after decoding it to string). If it doesn't I return None.
    At this part I used urlparse.parse_qs on the Raw layer of the packet in order to get a dictionary with query variable names as keys and the values are lists of values for each name.
    After reading and testing it tures out that the username and password are in fact query variables, so its left to do is to access the username/password entries.
