Winston side:
    I took the original message and converted it to bytes and then to integer.
    Then with shifting, I sent every tree bits to julia in the reserved bits of an SYN packet.
    As mentioned in the instructions the ack field in every packet is the total number of trios winston need to send,
    and the seq number is the index of the current trio.

Julia side:
    julia has a dictionary which keys are the trio indices and the values are the actual trios.
    I used scapy sniff to capture all the packets from the SRC_PORT.
    every SYN packet that julia sees (on the SRC_PORT) she update the dictionary with the trio index and the trio itself. 
    I chose dictionary so that a trio could not be stores twice!
    When the size of the dictionary is equal to the total number of trios (stored in the ack number) julia stops sniffing.
    I used the stop_filter argument in the sniff method to know when to stop sniffing (taken from #https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19794798/scapy-count-number-of-sniffed-packets).
    After julia done sniffing she reaasemble the trios to the whole message (again with shifting and stuff).
