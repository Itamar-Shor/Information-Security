generate_syn_packets implementation:
    I've generate a syn packet (flags=SYN) for every dastination port (with the given ip addr).

analyze_scan implementation:
    If we get a response with SYN+ACK then the port is OPEN.
    If we get a response with RST+ACK then the port is CLOSED.
    If we don't get any response - we assume that the port is FILTERED.
    Based on that logic - I've initialized all the ports to be marked as FILTERED. 
    Then I've went over all the answers and base on the flags I've determined if the port is CLOSED or OPEN.

This is called a stealth syn scan because we've never complete the TCP connection (handshakes).
